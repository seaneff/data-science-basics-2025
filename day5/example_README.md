This repository contains work I completed as part of a Data Science Basics in R course. The repository contains code to:

- read in a new dataset 
- calculate summary statistics
- generate a data visualization 

I looked at data related to XXXXXX. I explored XXXXXX by calculating XXXXXX. To visualize the data, I created a XXXXX that shows XXXXXXX.

For example: "I looked at data related to measles vaccination programs, globally. I explored differences in measles vaccination coverage across regions by calculating the average country-level vaccination coverage per region. To visualize the data, I created a boxplot that shows the regions with the highest and the lowest levels of measles vaccination coverage"

For example: "I looked at data related to global utilization of renewable energy, and how it has changed over time. I explored differences in energy mix based on country income designations and region. To visualize the data, I created a barchart that shows 10 countries who are leading the way in renewable energy -- they have the highest shares of their total electricity utilization that come from renewable sources."
